**FollowUp** is a contact management app specifically designed for disciples, helping you to effectively follow up with and manage the relationships you build with prospects.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **👥 Recent Contacts Overview:** Forgot who you met this week? FollowUp lists all your most recently met contacts first, starting with those you met this week.
- **🎯 Daily FollowUp Goals:** Set a daily FollowUp goal to encourage you to keep reaching out to people.
- **📑 Dedicated FollowUp List:** Never forget who you are building relationships with - add contacts to a dedicated FollowUp list and highlight key contacts.
- **⚡️ Quick Messaging with AI:** Reach out 2-3x quicker with customizable AI-powered conversation starters. Use ChatGPT to generate personalized conversation prompts based on your contact’s details, and send messages directly through WhatsApp with just one tap.
- **🔁 Seamless Integration with Native Contacts:** No need to change your workflow - FollowUp syncs with your phone's native Contacts app, ensuring all your contact information stays in one place.

### FollowUp helps you answer these two important questions:

- **Who did I meet this week?**
- **Who should I reach out to next?**
